This is my personal portfolio of projects.

## Library
The library project was part of the "Softwaretechnik" module in the third semester of my course.

The program supports logging in with a user and, depending on the user's privileges, add and remove books from the library and/or borrow and return books.
It was meant to be a management software for a fictitious library

The project was developed by:
- Karol Fedurko
- Daniel Hammerschmidt
- Tim Karelin
- Nicolai Herrmann
- Robin Hackh
- Jason Patrick Duffy

My concrete responsibility was the functionality of the book returns. 

(see "src\main\java\swt\library\ReturnBookController.java" and "src\main\resources\swt\library\returnBook.fxml")

I:
- ...created the GUI and logic for the return of the books
- ...helped create the DB table for the list of borrowed books and conceptionalized the return logic
- ...created the rating system with a DB table
- ...helped other teammembers with various problems
